# WWTP-calculator
A calculator for activated sludge tank, still under working.

05/04/2020  
just a simple ASAL model to calculate oxygen uptake rate for an assumed WWTP steady state operation.

05/19/2020  
upload two excel calculation sheets for ASM1/ASM3/ASAL algorithm.  
Currenctly plan to re-write the code in python based on these sheets.

05/21/2020  
1.fix an error for calculation hydrolysis of entrapped organic nitrogen in ASM excel sheet.   
2.complete a python code for simulating batch experiments using ASM1.   

06/09/2020  
Add aeration control part (constant and on and off control) for comparison different aeration strategy performance. 

06/18/202  
Add a simple model (DO/BOD/MLSS) and its curve_fit ipynb
