# WWTP-calculator
A calculator for activated sludge tank, still under working.

05/04/2020  
just a simple ASAL model to calculate oxygen uptake rate for an assumed WWTP steady state operation.

05/19/2020  
upload two excel calculation sheets for ASM1/ASM3/ASAL algorithm.  
Currenctly plan to re-write the code in python based on these sheets.

05/21/2020  
1.fix an error for calculation hydrolysis of entrapped organic nitrogen in ASM excel sheet.  
2.update a ipynb for the batch experiment calculation using ASM 1. (as the batch only have oxygen, substrate and MLSS data)
